# Calendar graphics

I came up with this idea last night (On 2021 Tuesday August 31st) which is for a digital calendar that can replicate a paper calendar even better. To do so, I noted 1 thing that digital calendars don't have: the monthly pictures.

For example, a cat-themed calendar might have a picture of a Tiger for June and a Snow Leopard for December. We don't seem to have any digital equivalent to this.

Here, I plan to make it so users can choose graphics for each month in each year in their calendar, and have better support for exporting their calendars.
