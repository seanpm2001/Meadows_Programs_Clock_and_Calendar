# Calendar

There is so much still to do, the calendar is looking especially difficult. Today I only wrote a script for the Gregorian calendar, and it turned out really bad, but it is a starter boilerplate, and a decent foundation to work and improve on.

Something that really screwed it up was leap years, a common nightmare for programming with time. The script got really screwed up, and there just became too many `if` and `elif` statements, and the number of days in a year got miscalculated somewhere and ended at over 380 days.

This is not all that I had planned. My new goals for a computer calendar today included support for images on calendars, and an exportable format.

- [x] Images in calendars (partial)

- [ ] Exportable format

I didn't get to the 2nd goal. This is also only the Gregorian calendar for a single year, and I plan to go back all the way to the beginning of time, and to the possible end of time, with events, and various calendar types. There is still a lot to do, including:

- [ ] Make calendars function down to the beginning of time

- [ ] Include support for every calendar type (even obscure ones like the North Korean calendar, included for historical/archival purposes)

- [ ] Get every time system change down (1900, etc.)

- [ ] Enter world events into the calendar (for example: 2001 March 21st, GBA released by Nintendo in Japan, Sean Patrick Myrick born)

- [ ] Allow the creation of world events into the calendar

- [ ] Add support for calendar notifications

- [ ] Make the calendar program a functional, portable Linux program (for classical computers)

- [ ] Make the calendar program a functional, portable Linux program (for classical and Quantum computers)

- [ ] Get 128 bit support established

- [ ] Allow custom themes

- [ ] Allow exporting

- [ ] Allow setting events

- [ ] Allow time travel

- [ ] Allow images in calendars

- [ ] Add animations

- [ ] Interlock with all Meadows settings for clock and calendar

- [ ] Make the program efficient

- [ ] Test the program on a quantum computer

- [ ] Test the program on several quantum computers

- [ ] Much more

Also, please note: Meadows programs will not be available for the Snapcraft platform, as I don't feel like they fit here, and this is a project that already requires so much work, I can't have development time go into Snaps. I want to get this project done in my life time (not just the clock and calendar, the entire operating system and all its features) it is one of my major life goals.

Personal note: I like talking about what I do, I feel like I should try to do this with everything, especially Meadows, as there is a lot to this.
